## Notes

Utility classes are a common practice for css styling that is often thoughts of as a cross cutting style like e.g floats, clear and display.

Think of it as a common style you want to add to an existing element with it's own styles.

This concept can be taken to the extreme and utility classes can be used to build entire applications, you can think of it as making tiny blocks of styling and using them to create the styling for entire applications.
